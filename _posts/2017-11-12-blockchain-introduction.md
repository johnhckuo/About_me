<p><h5>Why it is called 'blockchain' ?</h5>Because it is a chain of many blocks. Each block store some transaction records, and all the transaction records form blockchain. </p>
<p>
<p><h5>How does it works ?</h5>
Just imagine it is a ledger. If you want to join this network, you have to download and synchronize this ledger to your local computer to. This results in everyone owns a ledger in their own node. <br />
If there is any new transaction record coming in, all the nodes will be notified. If all nodes accept this as an valid transaction, it means that all participants have reach consensus and agree upon the establishment of this transaction. Lastly, this new record will insert into all the ledger everyone holds. </p>
